# Get Started

This guide walks you through installing dependencies, configuring defaults, and running the application.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

To install dependencies, do the following:

**a. Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)** (required for audio processing):

- On **Windows**:  
  Download from [https://ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), and add the `ffmpeg/bin` folder to your system `PATH`.

**Run your shell with admin privileges before starting the application**

**b. Clone Repository:**

```bash
  git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-suites.git
  cd edge-ai-suites
  git sparse-checkout init --cone
  git sparse-checkout set education-ai-suite
  git checkout
  cd education-ai-suite
```

**c. Install Python dependencies**

It‚Äôs recommended to create a **dedicated Python virtual environment** for the base dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv smartclassroom
# On Windows:
smartclassroom\Scripts\activate

python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu_2.6] --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
cd smart-classroom
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
pip install py-cpuinfo
```


**d. [Optional] Create Python Venv for Ipex Based Summarizer**  
If you plan to use IPEX, create a separate virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv smartclassroom_ipex
# On Windows:
smartclassroom_ipex\Scripts\activate

python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
cd smart-classroom
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
pip install --pre --upgrade ipex-llm[xpu_2.6] --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
```
> üí° *Use `smartclassroom` if you don‚Äôt need IPEX. Use `smartclassroom_ipex` if you want IPEX summarization.*

## Step 2: Configuration

### a. Default Configuration  
  
By default, the project uses Whisper for transcription and OpenVINO-based Qwen models for summarization.You can modify these settings in the configuration file (`smart-classroom/config.yaml`):

```bash
asr:
  provider: openvino            # Supported: openvino, openai, funasr
  name: whisper-tiny          # Options: whisper-tiny, whisper-small, paraformer-zh etc.
  device: CPU                 # Whisper currently supports only CPU
  temperature: 0.0

summarizer:
  provider: openvino          # Options: openvino or ipex
  name: Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct # Examples: Qwen/Qwen1.5-7B-Chat, Qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct, Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct
  device: GPU                 # Options: GPU or CPU
  weight_format: int8         # Supported: fp16, fp32, int4, int8
  max_new_tokens: 1024        # Maximum tokens to generate in summaries
```
### b. Chinese Audio Transcription  

For Chinese audio transcription, switch to funASR with Paraformer in your config (`smart-classroom/config.yaml`):
```bash
asr:
  provider: funasr
  name: paraformer-zh
```

### c. IPEX-based Summarization

To use IPEX for summarization, ensure:
- IPEX-LLM is installed.
- The environment for IPEX is activated.
- The configuration (`smart-classroom/config.yaml`) is updated as shown below:

```bash
summarizer:
  provider: ipex
```

**Important: After updating the configuration, reload the application for changes to take effect.**

## Step 3: Run the Application

Activate the environment before running the application:

```bash
smartclassroom\Scripts\activate  # or smartclassroom_ipex
```
Run the backend:
```bash
python main.py
```

- Bring Up Frontend:
```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5173
```

>  Open a second (new) Command Prompt / terminal window for the frontend. The backend terminal stays busy serving requests.

üí° Tips: You should see backend logs similar to this:

```
pipeline initialized
[INFO] __main__: App started, Starting Server...
INFO:     Started server process [21616]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

This means your pipeline server has started successfully and is ready to accept requests.

## Step 4: Access the UI

After starting the frontend you can open the Smart Classroom UI in a browser:

Local machine:
- http://localhost:5173
- http://127.0.0.1:5173

From another device on the same network (replace <HOST_IP> with your computer‚Äôs IP):
- http://<HOST_IP>:5173

Find your IP (Windows PowerShell):
```
ipconfig
```
Use the IPv4 Address from your active network adapter.

If you changed the port, adjust the URL accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

- Frontend not opening: Ensure you ran npm run dev in a second terminal after starting python main.py.
- Backend not ready: Wait until Uvicorn shows "Application startup complete" and listening on port 8000.
- URL fails from another device: Confirm you used --host 0.0.0.0 and replace <HOST_IP> correctly.
- Nothing at localhost:5173: Check that the frontend terminal shows Vite server running and no port conflict.
- Firewall blocks access: Allow inbound on ports 5173 (frontend) and 8000 (backend) on Windows.
- Auto reload not happening: Refresh manually if backend was restarted after initial UI load.
- If you encounter the error ‚ÄúPort for tensor name cache_position was not found.‚Äù in the backend, it indicates the models were not configured as per the instructions in the README. To fix the issue, run:

  ```bash
  pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
  ```

  Then delete the models directory from `edge-ai-suites/education-ai-suite/smart-classroom/models` and try again.
- If you face a tokenizer load issue like this:

  ``` bash
  Either openvino_tokenizer.xml was not provided or it was not loaded correctly. Tokenizer::encode is not available
  ```
  
  Delete the models folder from `edge-ai-suites/education-ai-suite/smart-classroom/models` and try again.
