# Sensor Fusion for Traffic Management

A multi-modal reference implementation for traffic management, enabling partners to blend camera and radar sensor inputs to accurately monitor traffic conditions.

## Overview

Unlock the future of traffic management with the Intel® software reference implementation of the Metro AI Suite Sensor Fusion for Traffic Management. This implementation integrates AI inferencing with sensor fusion technology, utilizing multi-modal sensors such as cameras and radars to deliver unparalleled performance. A traffic management system leveraging the fusion of camera and radar sensors offers superior accuracy and reliability over camera-only solutions. Cameras capture high-resolution visual data, while radar sensors precisely measure speed and distance, even under challenging conditions like fog, rain, or darkness. This integration ensures a more robust and comprehensive approach to traffic monitoring and decision-making, enhancing overall system performance and safety. This software reference implementation features four pipelines tailored to distinct sensor fusion use cases: one camera paired with one mmWave radar (1C+1R), four cameras paired with four mmWave radars (4C+4R), two cameras paired with one mmWave radar (2C+1R) and sixteen cameras paired with four mmWave radars (16C+4R).
