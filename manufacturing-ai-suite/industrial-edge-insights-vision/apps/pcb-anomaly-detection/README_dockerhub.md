# PCB Anomaly Detection Sample Application

This application enables real-time anomaly detection monitoring in printed circuit boards (PCB) by running inference workflows across multiple AI models. It connects multiple video streams from different cameras to AI-powered pipelines, all operating efficiently on a single industrial PC. This solution enhances logistics efficiency and inventory management by detecting anomalies before they impact operations.
