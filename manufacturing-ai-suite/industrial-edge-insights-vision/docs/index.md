# Industrial Edge Insights - Vision

Vision apps enable AI-powered real time monitoring for quality control purposes.
Their use cases cover detecting deviations and anomalies in manufacturing processes
by running inference workflows across multiple AI models on video feeds from
visual monitoring systems located on-site, all operating efficiently on a single
industrial PC.

[Pallet Defect Detection](./pallet-defect-detection/index.rst), [PCB Anomaly Detection](./pcb-anomaly-detection/index.rst), [Weld Porosity](./weld-porosity/index.rst) and [Worker Safety Gear Detection](./worker-safety-gear-detection/index.rst) seamlessly combine multiple microservices to provide real-time video analysis
enhancing quality control and compliance of manufacturing processes. Using AI-driven
real-time analytics, edge devices can detect manufacturing defects, safety risks and
worker compliance issues, that could impact quality, efficiency and safety of
manufacturing operations.
